# PoKai Huang
Hi, I'm an outgoing and energetic individual with strong communication and leadership skills. I'm a fast learner who is always eager to explore new knowledge and continuously improve myself.

---

I am currently working at Phison Electronics as a **Design Verification Engineer**, where I am responsible for verifying the underlying IP of UFS â€“ [**UniPro**](https://www.mipi.org/specifications/unipro-specifications) protocol.

Previously, I worked as a **firmware engineer** at Silicon Motion for 3.5 years, where I had experience independently leading projects. I was mainly responsible for developing TCG security features and designing test plans and testvectors to verify the correctness of these features.

In addition to my work experience, I proactively dedicate my free time to self-study. I have independently explored the inner workings of the **UVM library** to deepen my understanding of its fundamentals and have developed my own **UVM VIPs** to strengthen both my practical skills and theoretical knowledge.
