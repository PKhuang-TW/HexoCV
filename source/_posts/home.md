# PoKai Huang
I am a lively and enthusiastic person. I have participated in many camps and clubs in college, and served as an event leader to plan activities many times. Therefore, I am very familiar with communicating with a team and find compromises that everyone can agree on. Also, I have 6-7 years of tutoring experience, which has helped me to improve my communication skills.

I have been working as a **firmware engineer** at [SiliconMotion](https://www.siliconmotion.com/cht) since 2021. During this time, I have developed security features according to [TCG](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/) spec, fulfilled customized requirements, and fixed various of firmware bugs. After developing new features, I will <u>design verification flow and develop scripts to verify these features</u>. As the number of scripts increased, I have <u>modularized verification scripts</u> for easy management and development. Since each project often has slight changes to specific features, I extracted those features from firmware and transplanted them into libraries to to make it easier for everyone to make fine-tuning. In addition, I am also familiar with Secure Boot Authentication and Firmware Update Verification.
