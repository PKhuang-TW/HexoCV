# PoKai Huang
I am PoKai Huang, graduated from [Prof. Liwei Chan](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~liweichan/)'s Lab, the Institute of Computer Science and Engineering of National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), in 2020. My research area is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), mainly focused on exploring the possibility of novel interaction. My master thesis **"Eliciting Gestures on One Ear as a Centralize, Deformable Touch Interface"** explores the possibility of on-ear interaction, and has been submitted to [CHI 2021](https://chi2021.acm.org).<p>

My hobby is singing and I pretty like astronomy. I am lively and enthusiastic. I participated in quite a few summer camps and club activities during my college years, which also served as a team leader and cadre many times. I am easy to get along with people and know how to communicate and cooperate with a team. I have been a mathematics tutor since college, a total of 6-7 years of experience, which has also cultivated my good expression skills.
