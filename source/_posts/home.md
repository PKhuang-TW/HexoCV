# PoKai Huang
I am a lively and enthusiastic person. I have participated in many camps and clubs in college, and I have served as an event leader to plan activities many times. Therefore, I am very familiar with communicating with a team and find compromises that everyone can agree on. Also, I have 6-7 years of tutoring experience, which has helped me to improve my communication skills.

I have been working as a **firmware engineer** at [SiliconMotion](https://www.siliconmotion.com/cht) since 2021. During this time, I have developed security features according to [TCG](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/) spec, fulfill customized requirements, and fixed various of firmware bugs. To make sure the features meet the requirement, I will <u>design verification flow and develop scripts to verify the features</u>. As the number of scripts grows, I have <u>modularized verification scripts</u> to make developing new scripts easier. Additionally, I have extracted features from firmware and transplanted them into libraries. I am also familiar with Secure Boot Authentication and Firmware Update Verification.
