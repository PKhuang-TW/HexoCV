# PoKai Huang
I am PoKai Huang, graduated from [Prof. Liwei Chan](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~liweichan/)'s Lab, the Institute of Computer Science and Engineering of National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), in 2020. My research area is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), mainly focused on exploring the possibility of novel interaction. My master thesis **"Eliciting Gestures on One Ear as a Centralize, Deformable Touch Interface"** explores the possibility of on-ear interaction, and has been submitted to [CHI 2021](https://chi2021.acm.org).<p>

I am a lively and enthusiastic person. In college, I participated in many camps and clubs, and I served as an event leader to plan activities many times. Therefore, I am very familiar with how to communicate with a team and find solutions that everyone can accept. I also have 6-7 years of tutoring experience, which has helped me to improve my communication skills.

I have been working as a firmware engineer at SMI since 2021. During this time, I have developed firmware features, customized customer requirements, and fixed various firmware bugs. I have also successfully modularized firmware verification scripts to make it easier to develop new scripts. Additionally, I have completed the task of extracting specific features from firmware and creating them into libraries. Even though it is not easy to switch to a different product line, I believe that facing new challenges can help me improve myself constantly. In the futher, I hope that I can quickly learn and master new architectures to become a valuable asset.
