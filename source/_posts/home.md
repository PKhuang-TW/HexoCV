# PoKai Huang
I am PoKai Huang, graduated from [Prof. Liwei Chan](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~liweichan/)'s Lab, the Institute of Computer Science and Engineering of National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), in 2020. My research area is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), mainly focused on exploring the possibility of novel interaction. My master thesis **"Eliciting Gestures on One Ear as a Centralize, Deformable Touch Interface"** explores the possibility of on-ear interaction, and has been submitted to [CHI 2021](https://chi2021.acm.org).<p>

I am a lively and enthusiastic person. In college, I have participated in many camps and clubs, and I served as an event leader to plan activities many times. Therefore, I am very familiar with communicating with a team and find compromises that everyone can agree on. Also, I have 6-7 years of tutoring experience, which has helped me to improve my communication skills.

I have been working as a **firmware engineer** at SiliconMotion since 2021. During this time, I have developed security features according to [TCG](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/) spec, customized requirements, and fixed various of firmware bugs. I have <u>modularized verification scripts to make developing new scripts easier</u>. Additionally, I have <u>extracted features from firmware and transplanted them into libraries</u>. I am also familiar with <u>Secure Boot Authentication</u> and <u>Firmware Update Verification</u>.

Although, as a firmware engineer, it is not easy to switch to a different product line, I believe that facing new challenges can help me to improve myself constantly. In the future, I hope I can learn and master new architectures quickly to become a valuable asset ASAP.
