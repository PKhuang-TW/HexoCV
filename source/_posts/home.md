I am currently working at Phison Electronics as a **Design Verification Engineer**, responsible for verifying the UFS underlying IP â€“ [Unipro](https://www.mipi.org/specifications/unipro-specifications). Over the past year at Phison, I have participated in a full cycle of Unipro 3.0 verification, which includes:

* Designing test plans
* Discussing and modifying test plans with overseas clients
* Writing testvectors
* Verifying in-house DUTs and collaborating with designers on debugging

In addition to my professional experience at Phison, I have proactively used my spare time to enhance my skills by developing VIPs, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of the UVM and the underlying logic involved in the verification process. Please refer to [Project Page](/Projects/) for more information.

Previously, I worked at Silicon Motion Technology for 3.5 years as a FW Engineer. My responsibilities included developing firmware and security features, as well as troubleshooting firmware bugs. I designed verification processes and wrote test scripts to ensure FW features functioned correctly, modularized scripts for easier development and maintenance, and worked on extracting features from FW to create standalone libraries. In addition, I am familiar with Secure Boot Authentication and FW Update Verification.
