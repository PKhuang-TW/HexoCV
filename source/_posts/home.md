I am currently working at Phison Electronics as a **Design Verification Engineer**, where I am responsible for verifying the underlying IP of UFS â€“ [**UniPro**](https://www.mipi.org/specifications/unipro-specifications) protocol.

Beyond my professional work at Phison, I actively use my spare time to strengthen my skills by developing VIPs. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of UVM and the core logic behind the verification process. For more details, please refer to the [Project Page](/Projects/).

Previously, I worked at Silicon Motion for 3.5 years as a **Firmware Engineer**. My responsibilities included developing firmware and security features, troubleshooting firmware bugs, and designing verification processes. I also wrote and modularized test scripts to streamline development and maintenance, and worked on extracting firmware features into standalone libraries. In addition, I have hands-on experience with Secure Boot Authentication and Firmware Update Verification.
