## Eliciting Gestures on One Ear as a Centralize, Deformable Touch Interface

### Abstract
The external structure of the ear, or the auricle, is of complex form and has various degrees of softness, allowing a huge potential for interaction design. Opportunities for affordances around the auricle are abundant: the irregular shape accommodates interfaces for buttons and sliders; the elasticity gives the degree of freedom for switches; the softness of the earlobe allows it to be pulled as a trigger. In addition, on-ear gestures provide occlusion-free manipulation compared to eye-hand interaction, which enable users to interact with objects without hand occlusion. Previous studies have primarily explored the ear as a touch interface at large owing to limitations of sensing technology. To uncover the potentials of the ear as a centralized, deformable, occlusion-free, touch interface, we conducted a user elicitation study of on-ear gestures. We extend the existing compilation of consensus gesture sets to account for n first preferable gestures, leading to the n-rank consensus gesture set that puts acceptance of gestures in the first place. Our findings provide guidance for designs of future sensors and on-ear interaction.
